# Fundementals-of-data-Science-Workflow-
This Repository Contains the work flow of how I understand the data science basics 
The notes are written Precisely on every concept so that anyone can benifit from the repository without reading a lot of garbage;
I have used the data sets wich were provided by NPTEL-Python for Data Science course
All the Programming is done Using Spyder IDE , So I recommend running those Codes into Spyder IDE For best Experience

Thanks For Visiting , Best Wishes
